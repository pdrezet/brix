/**
 * Target specific representation of time.
 * There are two major operations that we need to perform when handling time:
 * @li determining which time is earlier.
 * @li calculating the difference between two times.
 * Normally, this is simple: laterTime - earlierTime gives the difference. The
 * difference is greater than zero if the earlierTime was before laterTime.
 * However, problems occur when we get clock roll-over: in this instance, laterTime has a 
 * smaller value than earlierTime.
 * @p
 * To deal with roll-over, we assume that no time difference will be greater than
 * half of the largest value that can be represented by EhsTickType (half of EHS_TICKTYPE_MAX).
 * We further assume that unsigned integer arithmetic handles overflows silently: for
 * example (1 - 0xf) % 0x10 should produce 2. 
 * @p
 * Given these assumptions, we can implement our operations as follows:
 * @li Difference is simply (later - earlier) % EHS_TICKTYPE_MAX. 
 * @li Determining which time is earlier becomes a matter of checking whether the difference
 * between the two values is less than or equal to half of EHS_TICKTYPE_MAX.
